# Full Stack Budgeting Web Application

This project was built independently without following a strict tutorial.

It is made from a variety of technologies including:

- React for the frontend framework.
- Typescript for the Javascript syntax.
- Custom CSS for the styling
- Django REST Framework for the server side.

It currently has quite simple functionality of:

- Adding a transaction
- Deleting a transaction
- Auto updating your balance based on the sum of the transactions in your account

I will be expanding the functionality in the future

Here are some screenshots to show how it looks.
